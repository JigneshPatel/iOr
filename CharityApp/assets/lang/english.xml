    <string name="description">		iOr is the only application that aims to strengthen mutual help among our people and in the world in general.
        
        Whether you are an individual, a professional or an association, we all need others to live and move forward, whether by giving or by receiving from his neighbor.
        
        Because the world has not been created by accident, because the man who lives there is its main actor, and because a Jew is never alone, iOr offers anybody to find help and or to help others.
        
        Through an good action, a good word or a smile, you can turn anything around you into goodness! Enlighten the world by loving and helping your fellow jew can make it suitable to the Divine revelation ...
        
        Those listed in the App as "ready to help", could be any Jewish willing to help others with no compensation. At the launch of this application, listed are Shloukhim of Chabad (Lubavitcher), currently in action around the world having the mission to prepare the world to receive Mashiach.
        
        Mashmaout, founder and sponsor of iOr App, has a Facebook page that broadcasts original and profound will of the Creator, to gather the Jews around their mission and objective, and to achieve it.
        For more information, log on to our page: http://www.facebook.com/mashmaout.</string>
    <string name="concept">		Our sages and Kabbalah books mention that the purpose of creation is to fulfill "God's desire to have a dwelling place on the Earth".  This means that the earthly world which was created spiritually lacking would be given to humans with freewill to complete and fix it in order to prepare it for the Divine presence in the world. This is done by people improving themselves and the world which thereby converts darkness into light and bitterness into sweetness.

		How can a person know what is good and what is not, what is light and what is dark?

		A person is named after the Creator - "Resemble the Supreme" (Adam - Edamay le Elyon). The purpose of man is to get closer to his Creator, this way he knows he is in the right direction. Proximity to the Creator is not physical, as the Creator is not a physical entity. As the human will gets closer to the will of God, then he becomes closer to the Creator.

		When a person is immersed and invests all his energy only in worldly desires and indulgences, he is doing the opposite of what the Creator is - the ultimate in goodness. Conversely, if a person does things for the benefit of others, for the benefit of the world or to fulfill the Creator's will, then he overcomes his own selfish desires and lust. This transforms the physical to spiritual and brings the person closer to the divine as well as bringing the presence of the Shechinah down to the world.

		We hope that this app would allow any Jew to strengthen their good deeds for the benefit of others, and in the merit of this - we will improve the situation of our country and the whole world and prepare it for receiving of the Shechinah (divine presence) soon with the building of the Third Temple very soon. Amen!</string>
