    <string name="description">iOr is the only application that aims to strengthen mutual help among our people and in the world in general.
        
        Whether you are an individual, a professional or an association, we all need others to live and move forward, whether by giving or by receiving from his neighbor.
        
        Because the world has not been created by accident, because the man who lives there is its main actor, and because a Jew is never alone, iOr offers anybody to find help and or to help others.
        
        Through an good action, a good word or a smile, you can turn anything around you into goodness! Enlighten the world by loving and helping your fellow jew can make it suitable to the Divine revelation ...
        
        Those listed in the App as "ready to help", could be any Jewish willing to help others with no compensation. At the launch of this application, listed are Shloukhim of Chabad (Lubavitcher), currently in action around the world having the mission to prepare the world to receive Mashiach.
        
        Mashmaout, founder and sponsor of iOr App, has a Facebook page that broadcasts original and profound will of the Creator, to gather the Jews around their mission and objective, and to achieve it.
        For more information, log on to our page: http://www.facebook.com/mashmaout.</string>
    <string name="concept">Midrashic sages and Kabbalah books mentions that the purpose of creation is "He wished God to be his apartment in his underwear." So the world is poor spiritually, created to a person who has a free choice to complete and fix it on its own and will make it to the Divine presence in the world. This is done by he corrects himself and the world and turn darkness into light and bitter sweet. 
How about knowing the person knows what is good and what is not, what is light and what it dark? 

Person is named Creator - "Land to the Supreme Court." The purpose of man is to get closer to his Creator and he knows he right direction. Physical proximity to the Creator because the Creator is not a physical reality. When the human will to the will of God coming to man become closer to the Creator. 
When a person immersed in worldly desires and indulgence only and there is hard as he is doing the opposite of the Creator - the purpose of grace. Conversely, a person who does things for the benefit of others, benefit the world or to practice their Creator, he overcomes his desires and lusts and self that becomes the mental substance approaching the Creator and inspires the Shechinah down in the world. 

Wish this app would allow any Jew to strengthen the good deeds for the benefit of others, and because of this improve the situation of our country and our world and prepare it for the Shechinah soon, the building of the Third Temple, speedily in our days. Amen! </string>
