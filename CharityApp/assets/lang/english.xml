    <string name="description">iOr is the only application that aims to strengthen mutual help among our people and in the world in general.
        
        Whether you are an individual, a professional or an association, we all need others to live and move forward, whether by giving or by receiving from his neighbor.
        
        Because the world has not been created by accident, because the man who lives there is its main actor, and because a Jew is never alone, iOr offers anybody to find help and or to help others.
        
        Through an good action, a good word or a smile, you can turn anything around you into goodness! Enlighten the world by loving and helping your fellow jew can make it suitable to the Divine revelation ...
        
        Those listed in the App as "ready to help", could be any Jewish willing to help others with no compensation. At the launch of this application, listed are Shloukhim of Chabad (Lubavitcher), currently in action around the world having the mission to prepare the world to receive Mashiach.
        
        Mashmaout, founder and sponsor of iOr App, has a Facebook page that broadcasts original and profound will of the Creator, to gather the Jews around their mission and objective, and to achieve it.
